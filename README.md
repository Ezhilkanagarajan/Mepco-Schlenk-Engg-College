# Mepco-Schlenk-Engg-College
This project aims to analyse the performance of the staff.
The student can rate the staff based on their way of teaching in the class.
Students are provided with a set of questions and they answer to those questions based on the staff's performance on the class like how they teach the concepts and so on.
Once the student has completed their own evaluation, then their responses will be stored and based on this response the staff score will be calculated.
Then,the staff can login to their profile to view their own scores.Based on this scores the staff can find and correct their way of delivering the information to the students in the way that the students can easily understand the concepts.
